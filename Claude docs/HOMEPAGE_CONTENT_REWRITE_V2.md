## PROOF SECTION: THE FASALTECH STORY

### The Problem Everyone Missed

Agriculture in India has 100+ stakeholders per transaction. Farmers, agents, middlemen, retailers, exporters. Everyone wants different things. Most tech solutions focus on ONE stakeholder and fail.

I built a business by redesigning the incentive structure so everyone wins.

---

### The Muskmelon Moment

Summer 2021. I saw a farmer on TV selling muskmelons for 10x what regular farmers earned. The reporter asked why.

*"Premium crops need premium buyers. I found buyers who pay for quality. Now quality is profitable."*

That's when I understood.

**The problem wasn't farming technology. It was economics.**

Middlemen bought by volume, not quality. Farmers had no reason to grow better crops. The entire incentive structure made quality unprofitable.

I needed to redesign the system.

---

### The Win-Win Model

I found farmers growing premium muskmelons. I found buyers who'd pay premium prices. I connected them directly.

- **Farmer:** Made more money per ton
- **Buyer:** Got consistent quality  
- **Me:** Took a margin for coordination

First deal: 5 tons of muskmelons to a local retailer.

It worked.

---

### Scaling to Seedless Watermelons

The muskmelon model proved something: **Premium crops + premium buyers + direct relationships = everyone wins.**

Next step: Find a crop with even bigger premium. 

Seedless watermelons. India didn't have them at scale. Grocery stores imported them or didn't stock them. Premium market existed but no one could supply consistently.

I spent 3 months learning seedless watermelon cultivation. Found farmers willing to experiment. Taught them the technique. Built relationships with Lulu, Reliance, Namdari.

By late 2021: **India's first seedless watermelon supply at commercial scale.**

Farmers made 3x more than regular watermelons. Retailers got consistent quality. We had a monopoly because no one else figured out the full system.

Revenue started growing.

---

### The Do-or-Die Moment

September 2021. Phone rings. Lulu Hypermarket Dubai.

*"We need 50 tons of watermelons."*

I said yes.

Then Maharashtra started flooding. My farmers couldn't harvest. My usual contacts couldn't deliver. I had never worked in Karnataka. Didn't know anyone there.

Two options:
1. Tell Lulu I can't deliver. Lose credibility. Maybe lose the business.
2. Go to Karnataka and figure it out.

**I went to Karnataka.**

Cold called farmers. Showed up at farms. Explained what I needed. Built trust in days, not months. Found farmers in Andhra Pradesh. Then Telangana. Then Tamil Nadu.

**In 2 months: Built 4 complete supply chains across 4 states I'd never worked in.**

Delivered 50 tons to Lulu. On time. Consistent quality.

They kept ordering. Then Reliance. Then Namdari. Then Zepto. Then Swiggy.

---

### The Technical Challenge: ML at Scale

By 2023, we had 2000+ farmers across 5 states. New problem: **quality inconsistency at scale.**

2000 farmers = 2000 different farming practices. Visual inspection wasn't enough anymore.

**Built ML disease prediction system:**
- Farmers photograph crops weekly
- CNN model (72% accuracy) flags disease outbreaks before they spread
- Django backend, AWS hosting, TensorFlow
- Processing 500+ images daily in peak season

**The hard part wasn't the ML. It was:**
- 2G networks (most farmers had terrible connectivity)
- Low-quality phone cameras (inconsistent lighting, focus)  
- Training farmers who'd never used AI ("Just take a photo like WhatsApp")

Did it work perfectly? No. 72% accuracy means 28% false predictions. 

But expert agronomists only hit 65% accuracy from photos alone. And our system was available 24/7 to 2000 farmers. An agronomist could visit maybe 10 farms per day.

**Scale changes what "good enough" means.**

---

### The Result

By 2025:
- **$4M revenue**
- **2000 farmers** across 5 states
- **Seedless watermelon monopoly** at commercial scale
- **ML in production** serving 2000 farmers
- **Consistent delivery** to Lulu, Reliance, Namdari, Zepto, Swiggy

The business worked because I understood what most people missed:

**The problem wasn't farming techniques. It was incentive alignment.**

Make quality profitable for everyone, and everyone wins.

---

### What This Taught Me About AI

I'm now learning frontier AI—transformers, RLHF, reasoning systems, production ML. Not because I'm abandoning agtech, but because I see the same patterns emerging.

AI is creating massive coordination problems:
- When legal work becomes cheap, court systems jam
- When expertise is free, credential systems break  
- When automation is universal, labor markets restructure

These aren't just technical problems. **They're incentive problems. System design problems.**

FasalTech taught me to:
- See misalignment before building solutions
- Design for real constraints (not ideal conditions)
- Execute fast in chaos
- Prove it works at small scale before scaling

That's what I'm bringing to AI product work. Not just the ability to code, but **the ability to see what breaks when systems change—and build things that work anyway.**

## WHAT I'M BUILDING NOW

**Spring 2026 @ NYU**

### This Week
[Most recent weekly update - example below]

**Week of Jan 27, 2026:**
Implementing FlashAttention from scratch for Greg Durrett's LLM Reasoners course. Spent 6 hours debugging positional encoding. Finally clicked why transformers need it.

Currently reading: "Attention Is All You Need" (5th time - each read reveals something new)

Next: Chain-of-thought reasoning systems. How do models learn to "think longer"?

---

### This Semester

**Building LLM Reasoners** (Greg Durrett, UT Austin)
- Transformers from scratch (not just using APIs)
- Attention mechanisms, FlashAttention, KV caching
- RLHF and GRPO for alignment
- Chain-of-thought reasoning
- Agentic workflows

**Leadership** (NYU Tandon)
- Stakeholder management, team dynamics
- Decision-making under uncertainty
- Organizational behavior

**Lean Launch Pad** (NYU Tandon)
- Customer development
- Business model canvas
- Market sizing, unit economics

---

### Current Projects

Building AI systems that solve real problems. Not demos. Not research papers. Products that ship.

**Focus areas:**
- Production RAG systems (how to prevent hallucinations in high-stakes domains)
- LLM reasoning (how models actually think)
- ML deployment constraints (2G networks, low-quality inputs, real-world chaos)

---

## PROJECTS

### H-1B RAG System
**Built RAG system for legal immigration Q&A with deterministic evaluation**

The hard part wasn't retrieval. It was preventing hallucinations in a domain where wrong answers have consequences.

- Built 100-question benchmark with must-include token matching
- Evaluated 5 RAG strategies for legal correctness
- Research-quality work on RAG reliability in regulated domains

**Tech:** LangChain, FAISS, GPT-4, Python

### Pico LLM Interpretability
**Understanding how small language models form representations**

Mechanistic interpretability on 10M parameter models. Discovered distinct functional roles across network depth: early layers handle syntax/position, late layers handle semantics/reasoning.

Similar approach to Anthropic's interpretability work, but on models small enough to fully understand.

**Tech:** PyTorch, transformers, interpretability tools

### FasalTech ML Production System
**Disease prediction for 2000 farmers on 2G networks**

Built CNN-based system deployed in production. The challenge wasn't model accuracy—it was handling real-world constraints.

- 2G networks with terrible connectivity
- Low-quality phone cameras (inconsistent lighting, focus)
- Farmers who'd never used AI
- Had to work despite all of this

72% accuracy vs 65% for human agronomists. Available 24/7 to 2000 farmers.

**Tech:** TensorFlow, Django, AWS, Flutter

## I'M LOOKING FOR

Summer 2026 AI roles where I can:

🚀 **Build products that ship to real users**  
Not demos. Not research papers. Products people actually use.

🛠️ **Work in messy 0→1 problem spaces**  
Where requirements are unclear, stakeholders are misaligned, and you have to figure it out.

⚡ **Move fast**  
Prototype → test → iterate → ship. Weeks, not months.

# STORY PAGE (FULL NARRATIVE)

## How I Built $4M Without Knowing Farming or Coding

*A story about guilt, failure, economics, and execution*

---

### Act 1: The Guilt

June 2020.

I was in my dorm room watching Game of Thrones. Outside, thousands of farmers were marching from Nasik to Mumbai in scorching heat. Drought. Crop failures. Suicides.

I kept watching the show.

The next day, the guilt wouldn't leave. I'm an engineer. I should be able to help. 

VJTI's technology incubation program was accepting applications. I submitted a project: *"Use technology to help farmers."* I had zero knowledge about agriculture. Zero connections in the industry. Just guilt and a vague idea that technology could help.

They approved it.

Now I had to actually do something.

---

### Act 2: Everything Failed

**First attempt: Build an app.**

Farmers can use it to get weather forecasts, crop prices, better farming techniques.

**Problem:** Most farmers don't have smartphones. The ones who do don't trust apps from random engineering students.

The app got 12 downloads. 7 were my friends testing it.

---

**Second attempt: Sell cost-effective pesticides.**

Farmers lose money to pests. Better pesticides = more profit. I'll source cheaper, better products.

**Problem:** The incentive structure was broken.

Local agents made money on volume, not outcomes. They didn't care if the pesticides actually worked. Farmers couldn't afford to experiment with unknown suppliers.

My "cost-effective solution" was just another product they didn't need.

Zero sales.

---

I was failing in a domain I didn't understand, with people who had no reason to trust me.

Most people would've quit. I kept going. Not because I was smart. Because I was stubborn.

---

### Act 3: The Muskmelon Moment

Summer 2021.

I saw a farmer on TV. He grew muskmelons. Sold them for **10x what other farmers got** for regular crops.

The reporter asked him: *"How are you making so much money?"*

The farmer said: *"Premium crops need premium buyers. I found a buyer who cares about quality. Now quality is profitable."*

**That's when I understood.**

The problem wasn't that farmers didn't have technology. The problem was that **the entire incentive structure made quality unprofitable.**

Here's how agriculture worked:
- Middlemen bought by **volume**, not quality
- Retailers wanted **cheap**, not good
- Farmers had **no reason** to grow better crops

Better produce = same price = wasted effort.

**I needed to redesign the system so everyone wins.**

---

I found farmers growing premium muskmelons. I found buyers who would pay premium prices for consistent quality. I connected them directly.

**The model:**
- Farmer made **more money per ton**
- Buyer got **consistent quality** (no middleman variability)
- I took **a margin** for coordination and quality assurance

Win-win-win.

First deal: **5 tons of muskmelons** to a local retailer in Mumbai.

It worked.

The farmer called me the next week. *"When's the next order?"*

---

### Act 4: Seedless Watermelon Monopoly

The muskmelon model proved something: **Premium crops + premium buyers + direct relationships = profitable for everyone.**

Next question: What crop has even bigger premium?

**Seedless watermelons.**

India didn't have them at commercial scale. Every grocery store imported them or didn't stock them. Farmers who tried to grow them failed because they didn't know the technique. Premium market existed, but no one could supply consistently.

I spent 3 months learning seedless watermelon cultivation from YouTube, research papers, and talking to agricultural scientists. Found 5 farmers willing to experiment. Taught them the technique. Provided technical support throughout the growing cycle.

Built relationships with Lulu Hypermarket, Reliance, Namdari—premium retailers who wanted consistent seedless supply.

**By late 2021: We had India's first seedless watermelon supply at commercial scale.**

- Farmers made **3x more** than regular watermelons
- Retailers got **consistent quality** (size, sweetness, texture)
- We had a **monopoly** because no one else figured out the full system

Revenue started growing. Fast.

---

### Act 5: The Do-or-Die Moment

September 2021.

Phone rings. Lulu Hypermarket in Dubai.

*"We need 50 tons of watermelons. Can you deliver?"*

**50 tons.** Massive order. This could change everything for FasalTech.

I said yes.

---

Then Maharashtra started flooding.

My farmers couldn't harvest. My usual contacts in other states couldn't deliver the volume. I had **never worked in Karnataka**. Didn't know anyone there. Didn't speak Kannada.

**Two options:**
1. Tell Lulu I can't deliver. Lose credibility. Maybe lose the business.
2. Go to Karnataka and figure it out.

**I went to Karnataka.**

---

**How do you build a supply chain in an unfamiliar state with zero contacts?**

**Day 1-3:** Drove to watermelon-growing regions. Asked around: *"Who are the biggest farmers here?"* Cold introductions. Showed up at farms.

**Day 4-7:** Met 30+ farmers. Explained the model:
- Premium prices for quality (not volume)
- Scientific grading (size, sugar content, firmness)
- Transparent payment within 48 hours
- Direct relationship (no middlemen taking cuts)

Most were skeptical. *"You'll pay less after you see the produce."*

**Day 8-10:** Set up collection centers. Trained quality checkers. Built grading process farmers could see and trust.

**Day 11-15:** First harvest pickups. Paid exactly what I promised based on grades. Word spread. More farmers wanted in.

**Found farmers in:**
- Karnataka (Bangalore region)
- Andhra Pradesh (Anantapur region)
- Telangana (Warangal region)  
- Tamil Nadu (Salem region)

**In 2 months: Built 4 complete supply chains across 4 states I'd never worked in.**

---

Delivered 50 tons to Lulu. On time. Consistent quality.

They kept ordering. Then Reliance started ordering more. Then Namdari. Then Zepto. Then Swiggy.

---

### Act 6: The Technical Challenge

By 2023, we were doing **$4M revenue annually.** 2000+ farmers across 5 states.

New problem: **Quality inconsistency at scale.**

2000 farmers = 2000 different farming practices. Visual inspection wasn't enough anymore. Diseases spread fast, and by the time we saw them at harvest, it was too late.

**Built ML disease prediction system:**

Farmers photograph their crops weekly using the app. Our CNN model (72% accuracy) analyzes images and flags potential disease outbreaks **before they spread.**

**Technical stack:**
- TensorFlow for model training
- Django backend for API
- AWS for hosting
- Flutter app for farmers
- MySQL for data storage

**Processing 500+ images daily during peak season.**

---

**The hard part wasn't the ML.**

The hard part was:
- **2G networks:** Most farmers had terrible connectivity. Had to compress images without losing diagnostic quality.
- **Low-quality cameras:** Inconsistent lighting, focus, angles. Model had to work despite this.
- **Farmer training:** Many had never used AI. Had to make it as simple as: *"Take a photo like you would for WhatsApp."*

---

Did it work perfectly? No.

72% accuracy means **28% false predictions.** Some farmers got unnecessary disease warnings. Some diseases were missed.

But here's the context:
- Expert agronomists hit only **65% accuracy** from photos alone
- Our system was available **24/7** to **2000 farmers**
- An agronomist could visit maybe **10 farms per day**

**Scale changes what "good enough" means.**

---

### Act 7: The Outcome

By 2025:
- **$4M revenue** (from $5K in 2022)
- **2000 farmers** across 5 states
- **Seedless watermelon monopoly** at commercial scale
- **ML disease prediction** deployed in production
- **Consistent delivery** to Lulu, Reliance, Namdari, Zepto, Swiggy

---

**The business worked because I understood what most people missed:**

**The problem wasn't farming techniques. It was incentive alignment.**

Make quality profitable for everyone, and everyone wins.

---

### Act 8: What This Taught Me About AI

I'm now learning frontier AI—transformers, RLHF, reasoning systems, production ML systems. Not because I'm abandoning agtech, but because I see the same patterns emerging.

**AI is about to create massive coordination problems:**
- When legal work becomes cheap, **court systems jam**
- When expertise is free, **credential systems break**
- When automation is universal, **labor markets restructure**

These aren't just technical problems. **They're incentive problems. System design problems.**

---

**FasalTech taught me to:**

1. **See misalignment before building solutions**  
   Don't just build what users ask for. Understand why the current system is broken.

2. **Design for real constraints, not ideal conditions**  
   2G networks. Low-quality cameras. Farmers who don't trust technology. Build for reality, not labs.

3. **Execute fast in chaos**  
   Zero contacts in Karnataka. Built 4 supply chains in 2 months. Speed matters when opportunity is fleeting.

4. **Prove it works at small scale before scaling**  
   5 farmers → 50 farmers → 500 farmers → 2000 farmers. Each step validated the model.

5. **Trust is infrastructure**  
   In broken systems, trust doesn't exist. You can't assume it. Build it through consistent behavior over time.

---

**That's what I'm bringing to AI product work.**

Not just the ability to code. **The ability to see what breaks when systems change—and build things that work anyway.**
