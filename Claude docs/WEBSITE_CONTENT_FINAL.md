## HERO SECTION

Aryan Thepade

I didn't know anything about farming or coding.
Built $4M in 4 years anyway.
Now learning frontier AI the same way.

MS Computer Engineering @ NYU | Graduating December 2026

## PROOF SECTION

September 2021. 

Lulu Hypermarket wanted 50 tons of watermelons. I said yes. 
Then Maharashtra started flooding. My contacts couldn't deliver. 
I'd never been to Karnataka. I didn't know anyone there.

I went anyway.

Built 4 supply chains in 2 months. Across Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, 
Telangana, Tamil Nadu. Delivered to Lulu. Then to Reliance. Then to Namdari.

By 2023: $4M revenue, 2000 farmers, India's first seedless watermelon 
monopoly at scale. Deployed ML disease prediction in production.

The business worked because I saw what everyone else missed: 
the incentive structure was broken. Farmers couldn't make money 
on quality because the middlemen didn't care. I redesigned the system 
so quality became profitable for everyone.

AI is having the same problem right now. Powerful tools, broken incentive 
structures, massive coordination failures. I want to build AI systems that 
actually work for the people using them—not just demos that look good.

## CURRENT WORK SECTION

What I'm Learning Now

Building LLM Reasoners with Greg Durrett at NYU. 

I'm learning how frontier models actually think—transformers, 
attention mechanisms, RLHF, chain-of-thought reasoning. 
From first principles. Not just API calls.

This week: [specific thing you're working on - 1-2 sentences showing actual progress]

Recent projects: 
- RAG Visa LLM with deterministic evaluation
- Pico LLM interpretability (understanding how small models form representations)
- Transformers from scratch

[Weekly updates →]

## PROJECTS SECTION

### H-1B RAG System
Deterministic evaluation of retrieval strategies for legal Q&A.

Built a 100-question benchmark with must-include token matching. 
Research-quality work on RAG reliability in regulated domains where 
hallucinations aren't acceptable.

[GitHub] [Paper]

---

### Pico LLM Interpretability  
Understanding how small language models form representations.

Mechanistic interpretability on 10M parameter models. 
Similar approach to Anthropic's interpretability research but 
on models small enough to actually understand completely.

[GitHub] [Notebook]

## CTA SECTION

I'm looking for summer 2026 AI roles where I can:
- Build products that ship to real users
- Work in messy 0→1 problem spaces

# STORY PAGE

## How I Built $4M Without Knowing Farming or Coding

---

### ACT 1: THE GUILT

June 2020.

I was in my dorm room watching Game of Thrones. Outside, thousands of farmers were marching to the state capital. Drought. Crop failures. Suicides.

I kept watching the show.

The next day, the guilt wouldn't leave. I'm an engineer. I should be able to help. I submitted a project proposal to help farmers. I had zero knowledge about agriculture. Zero connections in the industry. Just guilt and a vague idea that technology could help.

They approved it.

Now I had to actually do something.

---

### ACT 2: EVERYTHING FAILED

First attempt: Build an app. Farmers can use it to get better prices.

Problem: Most farmers don't have smartphones. The ones who do don't trust apps from random engineering students.

The app got 12 downloads. 7 were my friends testing it.

Second attempt: Sell cost-effective pesticides. Farmers lose money to pests. Better pesticides = more profit.

Problem: The incentive structure was broken. Local agents made money on volume, not outcomes. They didn't care if the pesticides worked. Farmers couldn't afford to experiment. My "cost-effective" solution was just another product they didn't need.

Zero sales.

I was failing in a domain I didn't understand, with people who had no reason to trust me.

---

### ACT 3: THE MUSKMELON MOMENT

Summer 2021.

I saw a farmer on TV. He grew muskmelons. Sold them for 10x what other farmers got for regular crops. The reporter asked him why.

"Premium crops need premium buyers. I found a buyer who cares about quality. Now quality is profitable."

That's when I understood.

The problem wasn't that farmers didn't have technology. The problem was that the entire incentive structure made quality unprofitable. Middlemen bought by volume. Retailers wanted cheap. Farmers had no reason to grow better crops.

I needed to redesign the system so everyone won.

I found farmers growing premium muskmelons. I found buyers who would pay premium prices. I connected them directly. The farmer made more money. The buyer got consistent quality. I took a margin.

Win-win-win.

First deal: 5 tons of muskmelons to a local retailer.

It worked.

---

### ACT 4: SEEDLESS WATERMELON MONOPOLY

The muskmelon model proved something: premium crops + premium buyers + direct relationships = profitable for everyone.

Next step: Scale it.

I learned about seedless watermelons. India didn't have them at scale. Every grocery store imported them or didn't stock them. The farmers who tried to grow them failed because they didn't know the technique.

I spent 3 months learning seedless watermelon cultivation. I found farmers willing to experiment. I taught them the technique. I built relationships with Reliance, Namdari, and other premium retailers who wanted consistent supply.

By late 2021: We had India's first seedless watermelon supply at scale. Farmers made 3x more than regular watermelons. Retailers got consistent quality. We had a monopoly because no one else had figured out the full system.

Revenue started growing.

---

### ACT 5: THE DO-OR-DIE MOMENT

September 2021.

Phone rings. Lulu Hypermarket. They want 50 tons of watermelons. Massive order. Could change everything for FasalTech.

I said yes.

Then Maharashtra started flooding. My farmers couldn't harvest. My usual contacts in other states couldn't deliver the volume. I had never been to Karnataka. I didn't know anyone there.

I had two options:
1. Tell Lulu I can't deliver. Lose credibility. Maybe lose the business.
2. Go to Karnataka and figure it out.

I went to Karnataka.

Cold called farmers. Showed up at farms. Explained what I needed. Built trust in days, not months. Found farmers in Andhra Pradesh. Then Telangana. Then Tamil Nadu.

In 2 months: Built 4 complete supply chains across 4 states I'd never worked in.

Delivered 50 tons to Lulu. On time. Consistent quality.

They kept ordering. Then Reliance started ordering more. Then Namdari.

---

### ACT 6: THE OUTCOME

By 2023:
- $4M revenue
- 2000 farmers across 5 states
- Seedless watermelon monopoly at scale
- Deployed ML disease prediction model in production (served 2000 farmers)
- Consistent delivery to Lulu, Reliance, Namdari

The business worked because I understood something most people missed:

**The problem wasn't farming techniques. It was incentive misalignment.**

Make quality profitable for everyone, and everyone wins.

---

### ACT 7: WHAT THIS TAUGHT ME ABOUT AI

AI is in the same place agriculture was in 2020.

Powerful tools exist. Most implementations fail. Not because the technology doesn't work. Because the incentive structures are broken.

Companies build AI demos that look good but don't ship. Researchers build models that can't be deployed. Users get tools that don't solve their actual problems.

I see the same coordination failures I saw in agriculture:
- Misaligned incentives (builders optimize for demos, users need reliability)
- Broken trust (users burned by AI hype, hesitant to adopt)
- System design problems (AI tools that don't fit into actual workflows)

This is why I'm learning AI from first principles. Not to build demos. To build systems that actually work for the people using them.

I did it with farmers who had no reason to trust me.

I can do it with AI.

---

### EPILOGUE

I graduated in 2024. Came to NYU for my MS in Computer Engineering.

Now I'm learning how frontier AI models actually work. Transformers. RLHF. Chain-of-thought reasoning. RAG systems. Interpretability.

From first principles.

Same velocity I learned farming. Same method I built supply chains.

Summer 2026: I'm looking for AI roles where I can build products that ship to real users, work in messy 0→1 problem spaces, and move fast.
