# THINKING FRAMEWORK

## META-QUESTIONS (Ask BEFORE starting any project)

### Problem Triage
- [ ] Is this high-stakes or low-stakes?
- [ ] Is this reversible or irreversible?
- [ ] Do I need deep thinking or fast iteration?
- [ ] What's the cost of being wrong?

**Decision:** 
- High stakes + irreversible + unclear = FULL FRAMEWORK
- Low stakes + reversible + learning opportunity = SHIP FAST

---

## THE FULL FRAMEWORK (When you need it)

### PHASE 1: REFRAME
**Questions:**
- What problem are we ACTUALLY solving?
- Why does this problem exist? (zoom out)
- What are the atomic components? (zoom in)
- What would success look like? (work backwards)
- What would guarantee failure? (invert)

**Output:** Problem statement document

---

### PHASE 2: EXPLORE
**Research:**
- What approaches exist? (50+ examples)
- What patterns work/don't work?
- What's the evidence?

**Generate Options:**
- Option A: [Strengths/Weaknesses/Trade-offs]
- Option B: [Strengths/Weaknesses/Trade-offs]
- Option C: [Strengths/Weaknesses/Trade-offs]
(Minimum 3-5 options)

**Output:** Landscape analysis document

---

### PHASE 3: EVALUATE
**Multi-Lens Analysis:**
- Lens 1 (Primary stakeholder): What matters?
- Lens 2 (Secondary stakeholder): What matters?
- Lens 3 (Future self): What matters?

**Find Trade-offs:**
- What conflicts between lenses?
- What's non-negotiable?
- What's the "one thing" that matters most?

**Pre-Mortem:**
- What would make this fail in 6 months?
- How do we design to avoid that?

**Output:** Decision matrix

---

### PHASE 4: DECIDE
**Forcing Functions:**
- If I could only do ONE thing, what would it be?
- If this shipped in 48 hours, what gets cut?
- If they only remember ONE thing, what should it be?

**Lock Strategy:**
- What we're building: [X]
- Why (which lens won): [Y]
- What we're NOT building: [Z]

**Output:** Strategy lock document

---

### PHASE 5: EXECUTE
**Modular Build:**
- Module 1: [Component]
- Module 2: [Component]
- Module 3: [Component]

**Output:** Working product/system

---

### PHASE 6: LEARN
**Reality Feedback:**
- What did we predict?
- What actually happened?
- What surprised us?
- What pattern to extract?

**Output:** Pattern added to library

---

## PATTERN LIBRARY (Extracted from past projects)

### Pattern: Stakeholder Incentive Mapping
**When to use:** Multi-sided problems where parties have different goals
**How:** Map each stakeholder's incentives, find win-win structure
**Example:** FasalTech - farmers want profit, retailers want quality, you want volume

### Pattern: Information Compression
**When to use:** Need to communicate complex value in limited bandwidth
**How:** Find the one metric that implies everything else
**Example:** "Built supply chain in 10 days" → Implies execution, ops, speed, ambiguity handling

### Pattern: Hierarchical Problem Decomposition
**When to use:** Stuck at current level of abstraction
**How:** Zoom out (why does this exist?) or zoom in (what are components?)
**Example:** [Add your examples as you use it]

### Pattern: [Add more as you discover them]
